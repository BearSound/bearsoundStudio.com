* bearSound Studio House-Style v0.1
** Summary of House-Style Requirements 
bearSound Studio aims to deliver a wide and diverse range of audio content across multiple listening platforms. This document aims to transparently identify the services undertaken by bearSound Studio, henceforth included **as standard** unless noted otherwise. The document will outline both technical and editorial (subjective) requirements such as file type, sample rate, bit depth, and compression, equalisation, and silence.

Furthermore, this document provides guidance to those wishing to utilise the services of bearSound Studio by providing signal flow information, and relevant details regarding source materials. This is in hope that any potential client understands how bearSound Studio processes audio, and the importance of good quality source material. 

As with any form of media, the true aim of an artist is to fix something in time. Artists use paint and other mediums, photographers light, podcasters and musicians sound. To this end, any client of bearSound Studio is required to provide source materials that will ensure high quality results. A full list of client source requirements can be found in the table below. The inclusion of these requirements helps to fully outline the extent of the studio's post-production capabilities: that is, you can only do so much before making a bad recording even worse.

The below table sumarises the main points of the document for ease of access. Any items marked with an asterisk denotes an ideal attribute found within the /source material/, deviation of this is to be expected, within appropriate ranges, and should be adhered to at the best of ability given the circumstances by any client.

** Definition of /Broadcast Quality/ Audio

As the world of audio is ever-changing, specifying /Broadcast Quality/ in terms of Podcasting and internet radio is of paramount importance to post-production studios. Due to this phenomenon, bearSound Studio defines /Broadcast Quality/ to mean:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Audio which is devoid of audible noise - digital or analogue - within appropriate listening levels, whilst also portraying a dynamic range which represets the final consumption material (i.e. podcast/audiobook/music track) and a pleasing diffusion of frequency levels across the human hearing spectrum (20Hz-20kHz), without egregious amplitude of bass, mid, or treble bands.
#+END_QUOTE

** Defining a bearSound Studio Originator Reference
As per the documented requirements for the Broadcast Wave Format (BWF) metadata, bearSound Studio conforms with a standardised originator reference. This reference can be broken down into logical **chunks**;
